# Agent Communication Protocol - ACP 

## Overview

The ACP project aims to define a standardized interface enabling seamless interaction between AI agents across different technology stacks/frameworks. It provides a common protocol for effective agent collaboration and interoperability. 

In this repository you are going to find the documentation, specification and tools (SDK) to interat and use ACP.  

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity**: Easy to implement across agent frameworks
- **Generality**: Framework-agnostic design
- **Interoperability**: Agents can discover, compose, and collaborate
