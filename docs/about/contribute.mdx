Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP). This guide will show you **how to get involved**, the types of contributions we’re looking for, and where to find support.

## Share Use Cases

One of the best ways to help ACP evolve is by sharing practical use cases. These examples keep development grounded in real-world needs and highlight where multi-agent communication can add value.

1. Start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/discussions).
2. Use the following template to describe your scenario:

   ```md
   # Title  
   Use Case – [short summary]  
   
   ## Problem  
   [Describe the context and challenge you're facing.]  
   
   ## Solution Idea  
   [Explain how ACP could be part of the solution.]  
   
   ## Open Questions  
   [List any questions or feedback you’re looking for.] 
   ```
3. Engage with feedback from the community

## Implement Examples

Code examples are a powerful way to demonstrate ACP in action. They also help others understand how to use the protocol in their own projects.

1. Fork the [ACP repository](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp)
2. Use the Python SDK to build your example in the [examples directory](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/tree/main/examples/python)
3. Submit a [pull request](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/pulls) with your implementation

## Report Issues with ACP

If you run into issues while using ACP, whether something is unclear, broken, or missing, we encourage you to report it.

- Open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/issues)
- Include specific details:
  - The relevant part of the spec
  - What didn’t work or needs clarity
  - Suggestions for improvement
  - Any code examples that demonstrate the issue

## Propose Enhancements to ACP

If you have ideas to improve or expand the protocol, we would love to hear them.

1. Start a [GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/discussions).
2. Use this template to focus the discussion:

   ```md
   # Title  
   Enhancement - [short summary]
   
   ## Motivation
   Why this matters for ACP.
   
   ## Specification
   Sketch of API, data model, or architecture.
   
   ## Implementation Plan
   Who’s championing it & how you’d tackle it.
   
   ## Drawbacks / Open Questions
   Points for the community to weigh in on.
   ```
3. Engage with feedback from the community

## Why Contribute?

Contributing to ACP helps shape the future of multi-agent communication and supports the growth of a more interoperable ecosystem. Your contributions directly impact the development and refinement of the protocol, benefiting everyone in the community.

- **Set the standard:** Your work helps define how agents will communicate across different platforms, contributing to the creation of a widely adopted protocol.
- **Foster innovation:** By sharing code, feedback, or use cases, you're helping to build tools and practices that improve development within the ACP ecosystem.
- **Move the protocol forward:** Whether you’re solving technical challenges, refining documentation, or suggesting improvements, your contributions help drive the protocol’s evolution and support broader adoption.

Every contribution, big or small, plays a key role in advancing ACP and making multi-agent communication more effective and accessible.
