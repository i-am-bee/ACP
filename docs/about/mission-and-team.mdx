## Mission

Our mission is to define a standardize interface enabling interaction of AI agents across different frameworks and technology stacks. We envision a future where local, remote, and open-source agents can seamlessly interoperate and communicate across any machine or platform.

## Team

We are grateful for the efforts of our [initial contributors](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/graphs/contributors), who have played a vital role in getting ACP of the ground. As we continue to grow and evolve, we invite others to join our vibrant community and contribute to our projectâ€™s ongoing development.

## Governance

As part of the [Linux Foundation AI & Data](https://lfaidata.foundation/), ACP is committed to upholding the principles of open, collaborative, and community-driven practices. Our strategic and operational decisions are made transparently, guided by open governance principles.
