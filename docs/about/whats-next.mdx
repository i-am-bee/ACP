description: "Areas of exploration for future ACP development"
---

As the **Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)** evolves, we’re actively exploring new directions. Below are the themes and questions guiding our current exploration into where the protocol might go next.

## Identity Federation

How might ACP evolve to work more seamlessly with various authentication systems, potentially simplifying trust and verification across diverse networks?

- What are some potential ways ACP could integrate with existing identity systems?
- How might we balance security with ease of integration?

## Access Delegation

How might we delegate permissions to agents, enabling richer interactions while maintaining user control and security?

- How granular should permission models be for different agent capabilities?
- What mechanisms would allow temporary access grants with clear expiration?
- What are the potential risks associated with access delegation, and how can we address them effectively?

## Multi-Registry Support

What if ACP could support multiple registries, allowing for decentralized agent discovery and management across different networks?

- How would discovery work across independent registry systems?
- What synchronization mechanisms would support distributed agent ecosystems?

## Agent Sharing

What would it take to create smoother methods for sharing and reusing agents within teams and across organizations, promoting collaboration and reducing redundancy?

- How could we simplify the process of sharing agents, making it easier to reuse across teams and organizations?
- What security considerations would need to be addressed to safely share agents across different entities?
- How might sharing agents across organizations help foster collaboration, and what challenges could arise in doing so?

## Deployments

Could new tools and templates make it easier to deploy and manage agents, simplifying distribution across various environments?

- What tools or templates could streamline agent deployment, especially in different environments like cloud or on-premises?
- What reference implementations would help teams adopt ACP more easily?

## Evaluation and Monitoring

How can we better track and monitor agent performance, reliability, and compliance, using enhanced diagnostics and monitoring tools?

- What metrics would be most meaningful for evaluating agent effectiveness?
- What patterns would help identify problematic agent behaviors early?

## Governance

How might new governance frameworks help manage policies, compliance, and agent behaviors, ensuring that ACP ecosystems stay secure, ethical, and transparent?

- What kinds of governance models could help manage a decentralized ecosystem of ACP agents?
- What mechanisms would help ensure compliance with regulatory requirements?

## AI Gateway Integration

What opportunities exist to integrate ACP with AI gateways, unlocking the potential for advanced AI-driven interactions and enhancing agent capabilities?

- How could AI gateways improve ACP-based agent interactions and decision-making processes?
- How could integrating AI-driven capabilities expand ACP’s scalability and flexibility?
- What challenges might emerge when integrating ACP with AI gateways, and what are potential solutions?
