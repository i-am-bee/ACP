# ACP - What's New

## Major updates

1. ~~Pre-Alpha~~ -> **v0.1.0** ([OpenAPI spec](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/blob/main/docs/spec/openapi.yaml))
1. ~~MCP + JSON-RPC~~ -> **ACP + REST**
1. üêç New Python SDK: **`acp-sdk v0.9.1`**
1. üìö New documentation site: https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev

---

## Why REST instead of MCP + JSON-RPC?

MCP was designed to connect context to models. ACP was designed to connect agents to agents, with the following in mind:

1. **Ease of use and integration** (REST is the web standard; no SDK required)
1. Agent-to-agent requires an opinion on **message structure** (what travels on the wire).
1. Full support for **partial result streaming**.
1. In-built support for **shared memory/state**.
1. Designed for **long-running async requests**.

But since there are a lot of MCP clients out there, we built an [ACP-MCP adapter](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp-mcp)!
