description: "Learn how to pause and resume ACP agent execution"

ACP agents can pause their execution using the built-in `Await` mechanism. This powerful feature enables agents to await external input, which could come from human users, other agents in multi-agent environments, or external systems. Leveraging `Await` enhances flexibility, safety, and responsiveness in automated workflows.

## Why Use Await?

Here are several scenarios where `Await` significantly enhances agent behavior:

- **Human-in-the-Loop Interactions:** Request explicit approval, qualitative feedback, or have the external party choose from provided options (e.g., selecting from multiple suggested actions).​
- **Agent Coordination:** Pause execution to receive instructions, oversight, or validation from another agent acting as a supervisor or orchestrator.​
- **Data Collection:** Request supplemental data when initial inputs are insufficient or ambiguous.​
- **Frontend or Browser Interactions:** Interact with frontend or browser environments (e.g., geolocation, device capabilities).​
- **External System Integration:** Facilitate interactions with systems that cannot be directly invoked by an agent, prompting external parties to fulfill the awaited request.

ACP's `Await` enables dynamic interactions with external entities (whether human or automated) providing intelligent agents with practical solutions for handling complex scenarios.

## Example: Awaiting External Approval

<Tip>See the complete source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/tree/main/examples/python/basic/await-external-approval).</Tip>

This example demonstrates how to implement an ACP agent that requests and awaits external approval.​

<Steps>
  <Step title="Agent Implementation">

The agent sends a prompt requesting approval and pauses execution using `MessageAwaitRequest`. Once external input is received, the agent resumes execution and acknowledges the approval.​

```python agent.py
import asyncio
from collections.abc import AsyncGenerator
import random
import string

from acp_sdk import Message
from acp_sdk.models import MessageAwaitRequest, MessagePart
from acp_sdk.server import Context, Server

server = Server()


@server.agent()
async def approval_agent(inputs: list[Message], context: Context) -> AsyncGenerator:
    """Request approval and respond to user's confirmation."""

    # Pause execution and wait for external confirmation
    response = yield MessageAwaitRequest(message=Message(parts=[MessagePart(content="I can generate password for you. Do you want me to do that?")]))
    if str(response.message) == "yes":
        # User approved, continue execution
        yield MessagePart(content="Generating password...")
        # Simulate password generation
        await asyncio.sleep(1)
        yield Message(parts=[MessagePart(content=f"Your password is: {''.join(random.choices(string.ascii_letters, k=10))}")])
    else:
        # User declined, stop execution
        yield MessagePart(content="Password generation declined.")


server.run()
```

  </Step>
  <Step title="Client Interaction">

The client initiates the agent run and listens for events. Upon receiving the `run.awaiting` event, the client responds with an `MessageAwaitResume` to resume the agent's execution.

```python client.py
import asyncio
from functools import reduce

from acp_sdk.client import Client
from acp_sdk.models import MessageAwaitResume, Message, MessagePart


async def handle_resume(client, run_id):
    async for event in client.run_resume_stream(run_id=run_id, await_resume=MessageAwaitResume(message=Message(parts=[MessagePart(content="yes")]))):
        print(event)
        
        if event.type == "run.completed":
            print()
            print(str(event.run.outputs[-1]))


async def client():
    async with Client(base_url="http://localhost:8000") as client:
        initial_message = Message(parts=[MessagePart(content="Can you generate a password for me?")])

        async for event in client.run_stream(agent="approval_agent", inputs=[initial_message]):
            print(event)

            if event.type == "run.awaiting":
                await handle_resume(client, event.run.run_id)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(client())
```

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Await in Multi-Agent Systems

The Await mechanism is not limited to human-agent interactions. It’s also particularly useful in multi-agent environments:

- **Supervisor-Orchestrator Pattern:**  
  An agent performing critical tasks pauses execution and sends an Await event. A supervisory agent evaluates this event, possibly adjusting parameters, making decisions, or granting approval. After the supervisor agent responds, the original agent resumes execution based on the supervisor’s instructions.

- **Cooperative Problem Solving:**  
  Agents collaboratively solving complex problems can pause and use Await to delegate specific subtasks to specialized agents, waiting for their responses before continuing.

- **Validation and Oversight:**  
  Agents in compliance-heavy environments (such as financial or medical systems) can pause for external validation from dedicated compliance-checking agents.
