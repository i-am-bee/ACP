---

Integrate the Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) documentation directly into [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/), an AI-powered IDE. Cursor’s assistant will reference ACP docs, providing helpful code suggestions as you work.

<Tip>
  This method also works with other IDEs like VSCode, Zed, and Windsuft, etc.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Install Cursor

- Download and install [Cursor](https://cursor.sh/).
- Open the application.

## Step 2: Add ACP Docs to Cursor

1. Open Cursor settings.
2. Navigate to **Features → Docs**.
3. Click **"+ Add new doc"**.
4. Enter the ACP docs URL:  
   `https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/llms-full.txt`
5. Enter a recognizable name (e.g., "ACP") and click **"Confirm"**.

<Info>Cursor will index the ACP docs automatically.</Info>

## Step 3: Use ACP Docs in Cursor

With ACP docs integrated, use Cursor’s assistant to get quick references. Start typing `@` and select your ACP documentation (based on the name you provided).

For example:

`@ACP Create a simple agent that reverses user input`

Cursor’s assistant will then provide relevant answers and code examples.

<Warning>
Always double-check the generated code, as it might contain inaccuracies. Good
practices include:

- Breaking tasks into smaller parts.
- Writing unit tests.
- Reviewing and understanding generated code carefully.
- Referring back to these docs to thoroughly understand the ACP protocol.

</Warning>
