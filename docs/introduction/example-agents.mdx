Each example demonstrates how to expose agents built with various AI frameworks through ACP, preserving their specialized capabilities while leveraging ACPâ€™s standardized communication interface.

## BeeAI Framework Chat

Integrates the [BeeAI framework's](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework) ReAct agent architecture with ACP by mapping BeeAI events to ACP protocol messages. This enables tool-based reasoning steps and structured final outputs within ACP.

## BeeAI Framework Canvas

Another example using [BeeAI framework](https://github.com/i-am-bee/beeai-framework), this time directly calling an LLM and employing a custom logic for parsing the output. It utilizes the ACP's artifact functionality to include generated files in responses, allowing the user to iterate over the generated files.

## CrewAI Song Writer

A reference implementation of a Crew using [crew.ai](https://www.crewai.com/), exposed via ACP. This Crew generates a song based on a website provided by the user, showcasing collaborative agent behavior exposed as a unit via ACP.

## GPT Researcher

Integrates GPT Researcher with ACP using a custom handler that transforms outputs into structured ACP messages. This allows real-time progress updates throughout research tasks, enhancing transparency and control.

## LangGraph Greeting Agent

An example of a [LangGraph](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/) agent that returns a time-of-day specific greeting based on a provided name. This demonstrates how LangGraph can enable context-aware, responsive agents within ACP.
