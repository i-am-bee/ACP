## Overview

The models module provides `pydantic` models describing ACP data structures.

<Note>Location within the sdk: [models](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp/blob/main/python/src/acp_sdk/models)</Note>

## Core

Core models are used directly by the SDK consumers. They describe ACP structures like `Message`, `MessagePart` or `Run`.

## Schemas

Schema models are used by client and server implementations. They describe payloads of HTTP requests and responses.

## Errors

Error model describes errors within the system. SDK consumers can encounter errors in various places, during a stream, as part of the `Run` model or raised inside the `ACPError` exception.
